# WorkFlow

This is just a file for sketching how the overall system will end up working. Also for ranting about automation in an industrial setting, whatever gets my mood at the time.

So, I've just sketched out the flowchart for the system, it's pretty simple, with almost no branching and it's pretty easy to run through it, a simple project for a simple course.

I can already see that the problem will be the mathematical modeling, the programming will be easy.
